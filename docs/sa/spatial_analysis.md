The **Spatial Analysis toolset** provides practical analytical functions to derive meaningful spatial insights from geographic data with precision and efficiency. It includes tools for extracting elevation values at specific locations through spot height generation, as well as calculating accurate direction and distance metrics between point features. 

Designed for surveying, engineering, and mapping workflows, this toolset supports quantitative spatial evaluation, enhances positional understanding, and enables users to translate raw spatial data into actionable measurements and terrain-based information.

`Spatial Analysis Toolset` has two tools including:

- [Generate Spot Height](spot_height.md)
- [P2P Direction Distance](direction_distance.md)

Up to now Spatial Analysis Toolset of KGA Toolbox has only two tools. But it doesn't stop here. There will be more tools in the future.
