The Topology Check toolset is designed to enforce and validate spatial relationships within geospatial datasets, ensuring topological consistency and structural correctness. It enables users to incorporate feature classes into topology rules, detect overlapping boundaries, and verify the validity of boundary points according to predefined spatial constraints. 

By systematically identifying topological errors and inconsistencies, this toolset supports high-quality spatial data management, improves dataset integrity, and ensures compliance with cadastral and mapping standards required for accurate analysis and authoritative outputs.

`Topology Check Toolset` has four tools including:\

* [Add Feature to Topology](add_fcto_topo.md)
* [Boundary Overlap Check](bound_overlap_check.md)
* [Boundary Point Check](bound_point_check.md)
* [Topology Check](topo_check.md)

Up to now `Topology Check Toolset` of KGA Toolbox has four tools. But it doesn't stop here. There will be more tools in the future.
